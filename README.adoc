= Gitlab Pages SSL cert renewal with CloudFlare DNS

Docker image Gitlab Pages served on custom domains Let's Encrypt SSL certs for  using `dns-01` challenge using the CloudFlare API

Use this when:

. You have gitlab pages project
. You'd like to serve them on a custom domain - say example.com, blog.example.com
. You'd like to have those domains use Let's encrypt SSL certs.

== What you need:

. Docker
. Your DNS should be managed by Cloudflare - you'll need your CloudFlare email and Global API key from the cloudflare
console
+
[TIP]
.You don't have to be tied to your registrar!
====
Even if you have registered your domain elsewhere (Godaddy, namecheap etc), you can still 
 manage it with Cloudflare and use their API for programmatic 
access to your DNS records. Create a free cloudflare account, then once you've 
added your site, you need to go back to your to your registrar, and put in the 
cloudflare DNS servers there (instead of the registrar assigned ones). It's really simple!

====

. You should already have created alternate domains on which you want to serve gitlab pages [Settings->Pages]
. Project Id - from each gitlab project's overview page.
. A Gitlab Personal access token - from your profile page, create a personal access token with scope as 'API'
    * https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens[Personal access tokens]


== Getting Started:

. Create an empty folder - say `gitlab-certs`
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir gitlab-certs
cd gitlab-certs
----
. Create a `secrets` file with your secrets
+
[source,shell]
----
gitlab-certs> cat > secrets
export GLTOKEN=gitlab-token
export CF_AUTH_USR=cloudflare-user
export CF_AUTH_KEY=cloudflare-global-api-key
export CONTACT_EMAIL=you@somewhere.com
----
. Create a `certs.txt` file with projects you'd like to manage SSL certs for
    * Keep in mind that you need to have created custom domains for these earlier in Gitlab
Here's an example
+
[source,shell]
----
gitlab-certs> cat certs.txt

3341547 rraghur.in www.rraghur.in blog.rraghur.in
# 1231233 other.domain.in
----
. Run the docker image
+
[source,shell]
----
gitlab-certs> docker run -it --rm  -v `pwd`:/data rraghur/gitlab-cf-le-autossl
# INFO: Using main config file /app/config
+ Account already registered!
# INFO: Using main config file /app/config

Processing rraghur.in with alternative names: www.rraghur.in blog.rraghur.in

 + Checking domain name(s) of existing cert... unchanged.
 + Checking expire date of existing cert...
 + Valid till May 20 04:51:11 2019 GMT (Longer than 30 days). Skipping renew!

----

== Scheduled runs

You can put the docker command in your `/etc/cron.monthly` folder and it should auto renew
your certs whenever there's less than 30 days from expiry.


== Security

Protect your certs folder - ideally `chmod -R 700 *`. Also, `secrets` file - since it has keys to your
Cloudflare account and your Gitlab account!
